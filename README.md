# CS231a Final Project: Put a Ring On It
## Dea Dressel, Daniel Valner, Jessica Yeung

Building mobile augmented reality (AR) applications has become increasingly accessible to amateur developers in recent years. In 2017, Apple released ARKit, a development tool that enables creators to make smartphone-based AR experiences. In this project, we build off of the "SegmentationAndOcclusion" repository by Dennis Ippel, an ARKit repository that performs object detection, semantic segmentation and occlusion. There are two major objectives for this project. First, to learn about the built-in capabilities of ARKit and how the model uses YOLOv3 and DeepLabv3 in its implementation. Second, to improve two technical features of the repository, namely changing from static to dynamic sizing of bounding rings during object segmentation and moving from single to multi-object detection and segmentation during a singular, live feed. Both objectives were successfully accomplished.
